Munchkin Companion App

Introduction: 

The project is in an early prototype stage. The core concepts are implemented, but there remains a lot of work to be done. The goals/stages are highlighted hereafter, and will be updated as both I become more proficient and the project becomes more focused.

Versions:

0: Basic Wireframe/Early Prototype

Here we implement the layout and basic functional elements. Most of the app is inoperable.

0.5: Prototype

Version 1 elements are solidified: layout is revised, and the core mechanics of the app are in place and working.

0.9: Late Prototype

Code has been refactored to the point of diminishing returns. No new features have been added at this time. Design/UI is polished. Distribution via app store is the focus.

1.0: Bare Bones Release

We have the basic elements down, soup-to-nuts. 

1.1 and beyond: Add additional features

More features (tracking for multiple users, customizable UI, custom house rules section, links to tutorial videos, UI tweaks, voice command with wit?)


Functions: (V0 as of 1/24/15)

V0:Level Counter (for one user), settings, FAQS and Rules Section
